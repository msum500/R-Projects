Updated: 6.00pm Tuesday 9 May



The latest advice from MetService and Auckland Emergency Management is that the severe weather experienced earlier today is expected to ease overnight. Further disruptions to transport services and roads are not expected tomorrow.



To give our students and staff plenty of time to plan ahead, the University has made the decision that in-person classes will resume from tomorrow morning (Wednesday 10 May). Our campuses will be fully open as usual. This is consistent with the University‚Äôs preference for on-campus delivery of learning and teaching wherever possible.



Please be advised that this situation could change at short notice, so please continue to monitor news updates and the Auckland Emergency Management website<https://www.aucklandemergencymanagement.org.nz/>, particularly first thing in the morning.



We hope that none of you have been impacted today by flooding or damage to your homes. If you have been affected by the severe weather, please prioritise your health, safety and well-being above all else. Talk to your manager or course supervisor if you need to make special arrangements.

"""STATS 220: Data Technologies"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Week 9 notices: STATS 220: Data Technologies,"Kia ora tatou

Welcome to Week 9 of STATS 220 - and the second to last module of the course: Creating data from digital sources!!

You have two assessments due tomorrow:¬† Project 4¬†is due Wed 10pm, as is Lab task 5A. Don't forget my student drop-in hours are on Tuesday from 2pm to 4pm, and that the lab sessions on Wednesday are also available to get help with projects.

Projects/quizzes stay open for submission on CANVAS for three days after the due date, with a late penalty applied.¬†

I will try to get Project 3 results back to you later today! In the meantime, here is some feedback to help with your Project 4 submissions:

* A lot of students have lost the mark for the criterion ""The exploration.R file shows evidence of exploring data and use of comments (1 mark)"". I was surprised by this, as I had already mentioned in a previous notice this was how many students had lost marks in Project 2 and encouraged students to be careful they did show evidence of exploration for Project 3.

* There were also a large number of students who did not submit their appendix, and so lost a large number of marks as we need to see the code in the appendix. Make sure you check your HTML file and the criteria again before submitting - we can't give marks for things we can not see!

* You may have already started to see some comments and redemption marks applied to Projects 1 and 2. Generally speaking, the redemption marks were not done very well - with many students not following the instructions that clearly stated NEW additional work had to be completed and presented in the redemption section, and that you have to clearly justify how these marks were being redeemed. You will get another chance for redemption in Project 5.

One issue that is continuing to be identified by the markers is students who are not basing their project work on the R code approaches used in STATS 220. I know that students may be using R in other courses, but I have to assess the use of code approaches taught in this course to be fair and equitable to all learners. I also am trying to engage you with a learning design that focuses on building confidence with combining some core R code approaches. It is fine to extend the functions and approaches we have used (e.g. finding/using other arguments or functions from the packages covered) but the material presented in lectures and lab tasks is what you should be basing your project work on, not examples you find online or from other courses. Not engaging with the STATS 220 course material will disadvantage you for the final exam as well. If you have any questions about this, please just reach out to me üòä

See you at lectures and the lab sessions!

Hi! The URL is reading as a chr rather than a data table



`chr ""https://stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fergusson/stats220_S123/zoom_data/participants1.csv""



I ran {tidyverse} and tried to see if read_csv() separating the file encodings would work, and it still shows up as chr



Curious if anyone else has or is running into something similar?

Kia ora Matthew,
I hope you are well. I noticed that you were not at last Tuesday's seminar, according to the attendance list Evie completes. Please let me know in advance next time you cannot attend due to reasons that are out of your control so I can mark you off as 'excused'. We'd like to accommodate students who cannot be there in person and join the zoom overseas cohort on the odd occasion.
Let me know.
Kind regards,

RefWorks <refworks@proquest.com>,msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Welcome to RefWorks," 


Dear Matthew Sum, 

Congratulations on your new RefWorks account! We‚Äôre delighted to have you 
on board. 

RefWorks is simple to use and will allow you to easily and quickly collect, 
manage and share references, and create citations and bibliographies. 

Before you get started, we‚Äôd like to share the answers to the top three 
questions our users ask on day one: 

1. How do I import references from my old reference management service? 

With a single click, you can import your references directly from Mendeley 
and legacy RefWorks. In Zotero, EndNote, and other reference management 
services, simply create an RIS file, save it to your desktop, and then 
upload it to RefWorks. Click here 
<https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/RefWorks/Product_Documentation/RefWorks_User_Guide/0400_Managing_References#Importing_References> 
to see how. 

2. How do I import references or documents to RefWorks? 

There are many ways to import references 
<https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/RefWorks/Product_Documentation/RefWorks_User_Guide/0400_Managing_References> 
and documents ‚Äì all with a single click! Export references directly from 
ProQuest, Google Scholar, and many other popular databases. Import a 
reference file from databases like PubMed or from another reference 
management service. Additionally, you can manually create a reference in 
RefWorks. Install the Save to RefWorks 
<https://refworks.proquest.com/tools/?EML=welcome> browser bookmarklet, 
then click it when you‚Äôre on a web page you‚Äôd like to save - we‚Äôll even 
import the full text when it‚Äôs available. Visit our Knowledge Center 
<https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/RefWorks/Product_Documentation/RefWorks_User_Guide/0400_Managing_References> 
to learn more. 

3. I write in Word / Google Docs - can RefWorks help me cite or create a 
bibliography? 

Of course! Read this 
<https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/RefWorks/Product_Documentation/RefWorks_User_Guide/0500_RefWorks_Add-ons%3A_Connecting_Your_Browser%2C_Microsoft_Word%2C_and_Google_Docs_to_RefWorks#Finding_the_Right_Writing_Tool_Add-on> 
article to see which of our Word and Google Docs add-ons, for Windows and 
Mac, is suitable for you, and go to the Tools menu 
<https://refworks.proquest.com/tools/?EML=welcome> for download and 
installation details. 

We are continuously improving RefWorks based on your feedback. For any 
suggestion or question, please don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch. 
<refworks@proquest.com> We think RefWorks is pretty intuitive, but if you‚Äôd 
like a little more guidance, why not check out our tutorials 
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzmTj_AGeY59VoNv-0SvcCg>? You can also 
click the question mark at the top right of the RefWorks interface to 
access RefWorks resources and click the video icon to access the video 
tutorials at any time.

Yours, 

The RefWorks Team

Congratulations to the more than 6,000 students who graduated in five 
separate Autumn Graduation ceremonies across three days this week. It is 
always wonderful to see our students celebrating their achievements with 
whƒÅnau and friends.

I want to acknowledge their incredible efforts to stay the course through 
the disruptions of Covid-19 in recent years, and thank our University staff 
who supported them through such challenging times. You can watch the videos 
of the ceremonies by visiting Autumn 2023 Graduation Live Stream

Dean of Medical and Health Sciences

Professor John Fraser has elected not to seek a third term as Dean of the 
Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences to allow him to resume focus on his 
research. Whilst his term officially concludes at the end of this year, 
John has generously agreed to ensure the successful transition of the new 
Dean. An international search for a new Dean of FMHS will commence shortly.

Change One Thing Challenge

Congratulations to the winners of the Change One Thing Challenge 2023, 
which recognises great ideas that have made a material impact on our 
student learning experience. You can read about the 14 award recipients and 
their initiatives on the TeachWell platform

Further to my previous announcement, there's just one more thing you need to do ahead of our workshop next week.

On Tuesday we'll be creating data visualisations in R. This might sound a little daunting to those of you who haven't used R or any other programming language before. I'm hoping that one thing you will learn is that creating visualisations in R is actually not too difficult, even without programming experience.

If possible, you should arrive on Tuesday with a laptop with R and RStudio already installed. I have created an short instructional video (approx 10 mins long) for those of you who have never installed R or RStudio before, and you can find it [here] (https://auckland.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d99c7c63-8e1e-454a-910b-aff9002f5e0f). You can also find it under the [Week 9 module] (https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/98062/modules/250157). Please follow the instructions in this video ahead of the workshop so that you are ready to go when you arrive, or join our Zoom session for those of you who are overseas.

It's not a big deal if you don't have a laptop to bring along. It's fine if we have two people working together on the same device.

See you next week, and have a good weekend!

"""SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Looking ahead to Week 9: SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science,"Kia ora koutou,

Thanks so much to all of you who participated at our workshop on Tuesday. When I designed the activity I was concerned that I was asking too much of you in too little time... But you proved me wrong! I thought you all did a wonderful job. I was impressed with how quickly you managed to synthesise all the information and present well-informed critiques. Now that you are very familiar with some quite poor examples of communicating science to the public, you'll have some good ideas for how to do a better job yourselves with your final articles.

Next week on Monday we will be hearing from Associate Professor Paul Murrell on another topic related to scientific communication: data visualisation. An excellent visualisation can more effectively explain a scientific concept or finding that words are capable of. As I explained earlier this week, at our next workshop you will have some time to create your own visualisations. To get the most out of this session, your team should bring along some data related to your topic, so that your work can directly contribute towards your final article. If you don't already have data, I've written down some of my thoughts [here.] (https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/98062/pages/source-some-data-if-you-havent-already) If you don't arrive with any data, then I'll have some fun data sets for you to have a go with, but your final article won't directly benefit from your hard work.

Following the workshop, your group will submit a final visualisation on Canvas, and each individual student will be providing other teams with feedback on the visualisations they created via FeedbackFruits.

You will gain course credit partly based on the quality of your feedback, which needs to be informed by the principles that Paul discusses on Monday, and your personal experience in the workshop on Tuesday. So please attend our sessions on Monday and Tuesday so that you're in the best position to score full marks.

I am looking forward to seeing you all again next week!

Due to some personal stuff going on, I didn't end up completing lab 4A. I understand it's completely on me, but would it be possible to somehow publish the questions for students who didn't submit and/or for revision (similar to the revision test)? I have read through the lab instructions, but it'd be great if I could test my understanding.

I really enjoyed Thomas Lumley's lecture this morning. It amazed me how badly scientific discovery is often summarised by journalists for popular newspapers. I really encourage you to watch the recording. One silver lining, New Zealand science reporting seems to be more closely aligned to the true facts compared to UK based newspapers like the Daily Mail.

Anyways, I have a couple of points before tomorrow's seminar:

1. Please be on time tomorrow because Ben will go through the upcoming assignment (your individual perspective outline) first thing. It is a good opportunity to come together with your teammates and firm up who covers what, clarify, ask Ben and Evie¬† questions about the rubric etc.

2. Some of you may not have realised that the Feedback Fruits exercise (peer member evaluation) has 2 marking components to it, 1. for giving feedback and self assessment (80% of the total of 2.5 marks) and 2. for reading the feedback that you have received (20%). I have extended the deadline to Friday 5 May 4pm to read your feedback.¬†

Overall, I am impressed how well you all engaged with the feedback exercise and self evaluation, it was all very constructive. I can see from individual student responses in their self assessment that they were able to reflect on what to improve on or where their strengths are. Well done!¬†

It's Week 8 of STATS 220! This week we are wrapping up Module 4, and finishing our initial work at exploring {ggplot2} and data manipulations for visualisation.

Here's the notices for the week:

* Project 4 was made available last week and you can make a start on it now (and should!). The first part requires using a Google sheet and code I have provided to access the Gmail API to access emails from your student gmail account. Then it's mostly over to you to explore, manipulate and visualise your email data to create and communicate a good story! As always, everything you need for the course can be found under the Module resources tab on CANVAS.

* Lab tasks and quizzes. Don't forget to do these each week, particularly since you have multiple attempts. The number of non-submissions has crept up a little - I know things get busy in the second half of the semester. Keeping on top of things like the weekly quizzes and reviewing lectures the same week they were delivered will be better for you then cramming at the end of the semester üòä You also never know whether you will need that extra 1% or 2% to pass or get a particular grade.

Keep up the good work, stay focused, and I look forward to seeing you in lectures!

only single-use? XingYu Li just responded to the question by saying: Yes,
clozapine can be used fore more than once in treatment, in fact it is often
prescribed to use once daily at bedtime. But, here ""recommended agent for single
use"" probably refer to clozapine as only the recommended treatment solution in
New Zealand and Australia, considering its capability to reduce both positive

I missed out on marks for not using inline coding and was hoping I could get an example of it so I do not make the same mistake.

confuses me too since in the test it mentions that they are given treatment over

I hope your final work on the Project 3 is going well üòÄ. I am available on Ed Discussion, email and via ZOOM if needed for help.¬†

Your test results are about to be published on CANVAS. You will need to review your answers and these [marking notes] (https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/89757/files/10661805/download) (the marking notes have also been published on the module resources test alongside the test information).

Overall feedback on test:

* The results were good and similar to previous semester, with 87% of students gaining 20 marks or more for the test, and a median score or 26.5 marks.

* In many questions, students lost marks as they did not specifically answer the question that was given, including using contextual information from the question as part of their answer.

* Credit was not given for answers that clearly used sources that was not the STATS 220 course material, as course material from STATS 220 is what you are assessed on. This includes the lecture material, including the interactive aspects and live demonstrations.¬†

Based on previous semesters, the test helps provide students with feedback on whether their approach to learning in the course is helpful or whether they need to re-think their study approach üòÄ. Keep in mind that the exam will be a similar format to the test, but will be twice as long and is worth twice as much (40% of your final grade).

give your opinions‚Äîto develop a deeper understanding of the assigned material.
You'll have a built-in community working together on the assignment.

Welcome to Week 7 of STATS 220 - and the start of the second half of the course üòä I know there is a lot happening this half of the semester, but just a reminder that the course is designed to build on and reuse ideas and skills - so the best way to be successful is to keep up with the lectures and labs each week.¬†

Here are the notices for this week:

* Lab task 4A is available (please work through this carefully - it will be helpful for Project 4)

* The CANVAS quiz for the lab task is due Wed 10pm (as normal)

* Project 3 is now due Friday 10pm

* Don't forget you can attend either or both in-person drop-in lab sessions on Wednesday (9am and 12pm)

* The [Statistics Assistant Hub timetable is here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNu4lOdkxddpOGJuvYko5lGJR77fR6L88wI5Es73b90/export?format=pdf) but note that:

* Week 7: Justin's in-person shifts (1-2pm, 3-4pm) will be online

* Week 8: Justin's in-person shift (1-3pm) is cancelled.

* The test results will be out later this week - there are unfortunately a few things that need investigating.

Don't forget about using Ed Discussion. You can checkout the Project 3 mega thread to see what questions have already been asked, and ask private questions for anything more specific about your work.

The marks for Project 2 have just been released - sorry for the delay. Please review the rubric and comments for feedback on any areas that you lost marks for.

Overall, the standard for the projects remains very high, with a high percentage of students gaining either 9 or 10 marks for the project. For some students, it appeared material from the lectures - including interactive elements captured in lecture recordings - was not sufficiently utilised. Some¬†common issues were:

* Not talking specifically about your data when discussing tidy data

* Not using inline R code

* Not using validation for numeric responses (from short answer questions) in the survey

* Not actually justifying or discussing why your project demonstrated creativity (or not doing things that were linked to, relevant to, or enhanced your project)

Remember, Project 3 is now due a week from today, so you have time to ""redeem"" up to two marks from across either Project 1 or 2. If you have any queries about marking, please email me: [a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz] (mailto:a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz).

How do we remove na from our data table provided by the query link? 



For example, the table in the collectionArtistViewUrl shows the following:







We would usually do something like na = ""NULL"" or omit it somehow. Thank you!

Hi there



I'm not quite sure  is 



""Try out two different queries to the iTunes API, in order to create an initial data frame of 200 songs called initial_playlist""



meaning we need to create two data frames and then combine them to get a final one which contains 200 songs (like using the rbind() function) ?



Thank you

Hello! 







I have a specific and probably tedious question, but I am unsure how to get this 



small symbol between the cats and the limit value on my computer. Does anyone know how to get this symbol or which key it is?

Hi,

When the project says to try two different queries, are we meant to leave both queries in the exploration file? If so, are we meant to do anything with the one we don't use?

Thanks in advance.

"""SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,To complete: Teamwork evaluation: SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science,"Hi all,

Thank you to those who have completed the team member evaluation in Feedback Fruits as well as the self-assessment. However, some are not yet completed, groups 2 (74% complete), 3 (75% complete) and 6 (80% complete). I have opened up the assignment again and you have opportunity to do it¬† by¬† Sunday midnight. However, late submissions will receive a 20% penalty which means that your maximum achievable mark will be 2% of the total.

This task is an important learning activity on how to give and receive/act on feedback by your peers. While the first evaluation is only formative, it is important to engage with it so you know what is coming your way. The second Feedback Fruits assignment will be used to weight your individual mark of the group report (Scientific American-style¬† article). So best to get some practice and consider the feedback received.¬†

As always, any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to ask.

Cheers,

"""STATS 220: Data Technologies"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Another mid-semester break update üòÄ: STATS 220: Data Technologies,"Kia ora STATS 220 students

As you know, I was quite sick in the last week before mid-semester break, and then was on leave last week. This means the release of Project 2 grades and feedback has been delayed, which will be essential to many of you as you complete Project 3. Therefore, I have moved the due date for Project 3 to Friday 28th April 10pm.

We are still working to get the Project 2 grades/feedback and test results back to you this week. üòÄ In the meantime, here is some general feedback for Project 2 which will be helpful for Project 3:

* Some students appear to be starting with the Rmd report and only doing what is in the report which is (1) not helpful for your learning process but also (2) means you are likely to lose marks. The projects are designed to be completed in the order of the parts presented in the instructions. If you have not been instructed to create a R file or Rmd file, but asked to describe or explain something, I suggest creating a notes document to do that, so you can use these later when you write the report.¬†

* For example, in Project 2, you were required to create an exploration.R file, and then do initial data reading, summarising and visualising in this file BEFORE writing the report. A large number of students have lost marks because they have not done this, and instead copied what they used in their report back into the exploration.R file. For Project 2, Part B, you have been asked to do a similar thing (exploration first), and the instructions explicitly state what we expect to see in this file/code.

* The lectures are important for the projects, including the live demonstrations and interactives. You are expected to have reviewed all the notes, attended/watched/reviewed all the lecture content, and use the lab task materials to complete the project. This means, the code used should be very clearly based on these examples. Remember that you are being assessed on what is being taught in STATS 220, not other courses. If you use code not covered so far, this may be given credit for the creativity mark IF it is clear you understand how the code works, it improves/enhances your product, and is clearly related to the goals for the relevant module and project. You will not be given credit for using code approaches not taught in this course for the other 9 marks.¬†

* A large number of students did not use inline R code, even though this was clearly covered in lectures and interactive activities in lectures. You should be using inline R code for Project 3 instead of¬†echoing/printing output from R code chunks. You want your index.Rmd/index.html report to be aesthetically pleasing¬†and look like a report that¬†has not¬†been written with code. This is why we set ""echo = FALSE"" as on overall knitr code chunk setting. Make sure there are no messages, warnings, unformatted output etc. displayed when you knit your report. üòÄ

I will be unavailable all of Wednesday and Thursday morning this week, but will be checking Ed Discussion and emails at other times. Don't forget also that the Assistance Hub is open later this week too (see the timetable below).

This email is intended for Matthew Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

Your Semester One 2023 exam timetable is now available.

Exam timetable

You can:

   - Follow the instructions to view your personal exam timetable. To do 
   this, please go to How to view your exam timetable 
   <https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqODv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLYxqgqI7H7jB_oTz7~Pv9h&2=40591> 
   - View the full exam timetable at Exam timetable 
   <https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqODv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLYxqgqI7H7jB_oTz7~Pv9h&2=40592> 

A list of invigilated exams (modes B, C and D) are stated in the 'Mode' 
column in the published exam timetable.

Please read the timetable carefully as you must attend your exam and sit in 
the correct mode at the scheduled time and place.

When are exams taking place

The exam period is Thursday 8 June to Monday 26 June 2023.

In Semester One, exams can take place at three different times:

   - 9am 
   - 1.30pm 
   - 6pm (Tuesday and Thursdays only) 

Exams and personal activities

During the exam period, you must plan all your personal activities around 
your exams. You're expected to be available for the entire duration of the 
exam period as you're required to sit your exams. 

If you miss your exam, your grade will be recorded as DNS (did not sit).

If your exam conflicts with other commitments, you can check the criteria 
for sitting an exam at an alternative time or location.*

For more information, please see Alternative times for exams 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqODv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLYxqgqI7H7jB_oTz7~Pv9h&2=40593>
.

*Please note, if you're applying to sit an exam at an alternative time or 
location, your application must be submitted by Thursday 11 May 2023.

Students studying remotely offshore

If you're sitting your exam online remotely, all your exam start times are 
listed as New Zealand Time (NZT).

This means that if you're located in a different time zone and your exam 
falls between 10pm and 6am local time, you are not expected to sit your 
exam during these hours.

If this is your situation and you need your exam moved to within daytime 
hours in your location, please email alternative_exams@auckland.ac.nz.

This must be done by Thursday 11 May.

Exam instructions and regulations

Please make sure that you carefully read the Exam instructions and 
regulations 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqODv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLYxqgqI7H7jB_oTz7~Pv9h&2=40596>
.

More information

More information about sitting exams online, please see Online exams 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqODv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLYxqgqI7H7jB_oTz7~Pv9h&2=40595>

We wish you all the best in your preparation for your exams.

As we are nearly at the mid-semester break, I thought I would update you on a few important things:

* There is a delay on releasing Project 2 grades (due to me being sick) - these should be out to you at the start of the second week of the break

* Similarly, your test results will be released in the second week of the break

* I am on leave for the first week of the break, but will be available on most days during the second week of the break for any questions or help with Project 3

* Don't forget lab task and quiz 3B is due by 10pm tonight but remains open for three more days if needed for late submissions

* Project 3 is due on the Monday for Week 7, just before Anzac Day. I have set up a ""mega thread"" on Ed Discussion for general questions üòÄ

Well done on a productive and creative first half of STATS 220! I look forward to exploring even more data technologies with you after the break.

Hello, I was just wandering the difference between geom_jitter() and geom_point(). 



 I understand that geom_jitter() "" adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, which is a useful way of handling overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.""  I think this is the reason why the plots are visually different....

"""STATS 220: Data Technologies"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Week 6 notices + important info about tomorrow's lecture!: STATS 220: Data Technologies,"Kia ora tatou

Welcome to Week 6 of STATS 220 - just a few more days until the mid-semester break. Here are the important notices for the week!

* Test

* The test was conducted today online. Please fill in this form - [https://forms.gle/U48f4G1yB9rCyZJ69] (https://forms.gle/U48f4G1yB9rCyZJ69) - if there were any issues with completing the test. You will need to be logged into your university gmail account to complete the form. We will mark your answers over the mid-semester break.

* Project 3

* The instructions for Project 3 are now available under the Module resources tab. It is not due until after the mid-semester break. Tomorrow's lecture will cover important ideas related to this project. Project 2 marking is nearly completed, and my goal is to have this returned to you before the mid-semester break.

* Lab task/quiz 3B

* You may have noticed I pushed the due date back to Thursday 10pm for this week's lab and quiz, since the test was today. Also, the lab task this week is a bit longer, and attempts to make up for only having one lecture for this week. üòÄ

* Don't forget you can attend either or both of the in-person labs on Wednesday at 9am and 12pm, and there is the drop-in lab session via ZOOM from 5:30pm to 7:30pm.

* The lab quiz remains open for three days after the due date, if you need more time to complete the lab task/quiz. Either take the late penalty, or email me if there are good reasons for you submitting late.

Lastly, tomorrow's lecture will not be in person as I am sick. Instead, the lecture tomorrow will be via ZOOM instead - at the same time of 10am. Here is the [ZOOM link] (https://auckland.zoom.us/j/91307068289?pwd=eHVJdGVsWE9zT1IwcFRxLzRaSGtzQT09)¬†[the passcode is 831885 in case you need it].¬†

The lecture theatre will be available if you want to attend the ZOOM lecture together on campus, and I would appreciate anyone who is on campus tomorrow letting other STATS 220 students know the situation in case they don't read this notice and turn up for the lecture tomorrow.

"""SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Upcoming assignments: Tips and Due Dates: SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science,"Hi all,

we are getting very close to mid-semester break, it is scary how quickly the time passes. I am sure you all know that there are a few assignments due in the next couple of week. I had a quick look at some of the submissions and strongly encourage you to read the assignment instructions carefully, so you do not miss out on points. If in doubt, you can ask either Evie or myself or post your question on Piazza to crowdsource an answer. Below are a few things to consider (in the order of due date):

* Critical Bibliography due 2 April: Make sure to cite according to APA 7th. I had a quick look at the submissions and noticed that some of the references are not cited correctly. Here is a great resource: [https://owll.massey.ac.nz/referencing/apa-interactive.php] (https://owll.massey.ac.nz/referencing/apa-interactive.php)

* MyCDES Part 1 due 9 April: You need to post your actual written CV (delete your personal details) AND your screenshot of your CV360 score to the discussion.¬†

* Reflection Graduate Competencies due 9 April: A 250 to 350 word reflection with specific points to write about.

* Teamwork Evaluation #1 due 16 April: This is an exercise that uses Feedback Fruits to evaluate the contribution of your teammates to the group project. Please familiarize yourselves with the process. I have posted detailed instructions and a rubric under the Assignment page.¬† Also, do not worry, this first one is formative only which means your score will¬† not be used to weight your individual mark for the group project (but the second evaluation will).¬†

Wishing you all a productive weekend!

In 2021, Fast Enterprises was awarded: Great Place to Work¬Æ for 
Millennials, Technology, and Diversity! In addition, check out our employee 
reviews on Glassdoor!

Fast Enterprises is a provider of essential software and services for 
citizens and government. In 1998 we changed the way government revenue 
agencies support their business with the introduction of GenTax¬Æ. We have 
expanded beyond tax and now do implementations for Motor Vehicle, Drivers 
License, Unemployment Insurance, Unemployment Benefit, and Child Support 
agencies.

Much of the work at FAST happens on our client sites as part of the product 
implementation. Individuals who understand the technical aspects of systems 
implementation as well as the business needs of our clients fill these 
positions. Employees participate in the full project life cycle from 
requirements gathering through production support. Developers should have 
strong technical and communication skills, enabling them to interact with 
client and detail system functionality.

Implementation Consultant Position

As an Implementation Consultant on our team, you will be involved with all 
phases of the implementation of our GenTax¬Æ software solution. This 
position will be located in Wellington, NZ.

Consideration will only be given to candidates who are currently living in 
New Zealand. For candidates living in New Zealand but not in Wellington, 
relocation assistance will be provided.
Candidates should possess strong communication skills and should be 
pursuing a Bachelors degree in:

o Computer Science,
o Computer/Management Information Systems, or
o Mathematics.

FAST may also consider candidates from other areas of study when 
supplemented with technical experience or aptitude

Exposure to specific technology is not required. However, experience in the 
following areas is desirable:
o C#

Well done - we've now completed the first two modules and one third of the course! The test next week on Monday is based on these first two modules, so make sure you have read through all of the test information and revision resources. The test is your opportunity to demonstrate your understanding and practical skills with the learning objectives and learning experiences from the lectures, labs and projects. üòÄ

Here are this week's notices:

* Project 2 is due today 10pm. Remember, you can submit up to three days after the due date. If you have a good reason for submitting late, email me to discuss the possibility of removing the late penalty.¬†

* The Test is on Monday 3rd April 10am. Offshore students based in different time zones need to email me (Anna) ASAP to confirm the alternative time for the test. [Here's the link to the test information and practice/revision materials again.] (https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fergusson/stats220_S123/test_info_practice.html) Remember, it's online and there no lecture on Monday as the test is during this time instead.

* Lab task 3A is due Wed 10pm. Make sure you complete the lab quizzes as a human who is trying to better understand how to do things with data and R. You have multiple attempts to help you learn. If the ""robot"" auto-marking does something weird, please email me (Anna) to let me know.

Lastly, so far there have only been two responses to my¬†feedback form that is always available under the¬†Support and feedback tab of our CANVAS homepage. I couldn't even do Project 2 based on that kind of response rate üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ

Here's the link to the feedback form again: ¬†[https://forms.gle/Vq4rLkJ686qeXzMr7] (https://forms.gle/Vq4rLkJ686qeXzMr7)¬†

The feedback received so far is below, which is much appreciated.

What are things about the course or teaching that are working well to support your learning?

What ideas do you have for other things the course or teaching could be doing, and why do you think these would help your learning?

pretty much everything, Anna is very friendly and well prepared for this course:)

im thinking if it's possible to zoom in or enlarge the font a little bit when it comes to Rstudio, its a bit hard to see things from the middle of the lecture room.

lab task pages

Doing more illustration of r codes in the lecture

I also got an email from a student last week about sharing links and live code snippets from lectures, which you can now find under the Module resources.

See you all at the lecture tomorrow!

Good day all!



I might have a silly Question on lab 3A.



When you use the  arrange() function on the mode_name, a character variable.  Does the R code actually 'understand' the word and arrange it  from major to minor  OR minor to major?  I see how it can arrange number in the desired direction, but not with character variables; it just looks like ...

Next week we welcome Dame Professor Juliet Gerrard, New Zealand's Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor (PMCSA), Kaitohutohu MƒÅtanga P≈´taiao Matua ki te Pirimia, who will introduce you to policy changes in the area of plastics based on the 2019 report from the Office of the PMCSA.

Please have a look at the report [Rethinking plastics in Aotearoa New Zealand | Office of the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor (pmcsa.ac.nz)] (https://www.pmcsa.ac.nz/topics/rethinking-plastics/) and the powerpoint ahead of Monday's lecture/Tuesday's seminar.

On Tuesday, you will have opportunity to ask questions from the lecture. Juliet will introduce you to resources that might support your projects, and have a general discussion about how science and policy connect, how this might be relevant to your group topic and so on.

For those who are not quite decided on what angle to take for their topic, below are a few useful links that can help you explore different avenues based on your interest:

* [Nanoplastics: state of knowledge and environmental and human health impacts] (https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/future-brief-nanoplastics-state-knowledge-and-environmental-and-human-health-impacts-issue-27_en) - A very recent¬† EU report with links to infographics that summarizes¬† current research in the space of rethinking plastic waste.

* [Our research at UoA] (https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/our-research/research-institutes-and-centres.html) - The Faculty of Science hosts several research institutes and centres; many projects involve multidisciplinary teams. This is a good launching pad for ideas on what you might like to tackle for your Scientific American style article.

* [Take 10 with our scientists] (https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/our-research/take-10-with.html) - A great way to get a glimpse into the work of our scientists and their discipline.¬†

Kia ora Matthew,

Career Development and Employability Services brings employers to you.
------------------------------

[image: Image]
 

Our 2023 CDES STEM Expo is here to get you hired, with over 90 
organisations attending!

Taking place across two days, this event will expose you to internship and 
graduate job opportunities that you didn't know existed. The exciting world 
of STEM is constantly evolving; you are the future of work, and employers 
are coming to campus to meet students like you.

Whether you are in your first or final year, start exploring a career in 
STEM and discover what opportunities are available to you. Mark this event 
in your calendar now!

Dates: Wednesday 29 and Thursday 30 March 2023
Time: 10.30am-2.30pm
Location: Engineering Atriums Levels 3 and 4, Building 401, City Campus

Who? The full list of organisations attending on each day is available on our 
website 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woRDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJbxqgqI7H7jB_tTz7~Pv9k&2=40515>. 
Registered organisations include Analytics and Research in Government, 
Atlassian, Aurecon, Beca, EY, IMC Trading, Kotahi Studio, Neptune Pacific 
Direct Line, Oji Fibre Solutions, Paihau-Robinson Research Institute, 
Sandfield, Tonkin + Taylor, and many more!

Some employers only attend one day of the expo, some attend both. Make sure 
you check the website to see if the employer you want to meet is attending 
Wednesday or Thursday (or both).

Come to the STEM Expo prepared to make an impression!

Our top tips to prepare yourself for the STEM Expo are:

- Research the organisations attending and their opportunities.
- Have an open mind and don't be afraid to ask questions. Employers often 
look for people with different background experience and transferable 
skills. Even if you're not studying engineering (for example), an 
engineering company might still be really interested in hiring you because 
of the different perspectives you can bring to their organisation. You'll 
get a feel for this by speaking to a diverse range of employers, rather 
than sticking to the companies that are obviously in your field of study.
- Clarify what you have to offer employers and build confidence in speaking 
to them by booking your place on one of our workshops 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woRDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJbxqgqI7H7jB_tTz7~Pv9k&2=40513> 
before the event to improve your networking and interviewing skills and 
reflect on your desired career direction.
- Update your CV and LinkedIn profile - we have a daily CV drop-in 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woRDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJbxqgqI7H7jB_tTz7~Pv9k&2=40514>, 
and an online CV building tool to help.

There's no need to register, just turn up on the day. This event is 
exclusively for students at the University of Auckland, so don't forget to 
bring your student ID!

We look forward to seeing you there!

We can't copy and paste but we need to use rstudio to run code; does that mean if we test our rode in rstudio we can't copy and paste it over once done testing? So we have to rewrite it ?

"""STATS 220: Data Technologies"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Mid-week 4 update: STATS 220: Data Technologies,"Kia ora STATS 220 students

Here are a few important updates for this week:

* Project 1

* I'm about to release the Project 1 grades. I haven't yet had time to read through every project and write an overall comment on your work, and will do this over the next few days. Overall, the markers were really impressed with your work and saw lots of creative memes and animated GIFs and work that went beyond what was asked. Some feedback was to be careful to follow the instructions and to make sure your code is readable and left-aligned (please don't use CSS to centre-align your code). I also would recommend allowing time to get help with any issues with producing what was required, as many of the lost marks were for things that could have been easily resolved by chatting to me or a tutor. Around 70% of students gained 9 or 10 marks for the project which is really good. Carefully read the rubric and any comments in the rubric and contact me via email ([a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz] (mailto:a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz)) if you have any questions about the marking.

* Help with Project 2

* I am not on campus today or tomorrow, so if you are looking for help the options are: use Ed Discussion to make a private post or email me as I will be checking both of these on a semi-regular basis. The assistance hub also has some hours of STATS 220 help (check out the timetable linked to under the¬†Support and Feedback tab on our CANVAS page). On Monday, I will also be available during the afternoon in my office for any course-related queries.¬† I can see a number of submissions already for Project 2 and some students may want to re-submit based on their feedback from Project 1. You can do this, and the most recent submission is what will be marked üòÄ

* Test information and practice

* The test is on Monday 3rd April and will take the place of the lecture for that day. I have released information about the test and practice questions on CANVAS which you need to read. Check the Module resources tab and scroll down to the purple ""Test"" row. Note, the course was totally redesigned last year, and that is why there is only one past test to use for revision. However, there is also a practice test I have written, and I have also made a ""mega quiz"" of all the Module 1 lab quizzes to help you revise.¬†If there is a reason why you can not sit the test at the scheduled time, then email me ASAP ([a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz] (mailto:a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz)).

I know this is around the time that things start to get busy, with assignments and tests. All the best for whatever you need to get done over the rest of the week and weekend, and see you all back in lectures on Monday.

implementation as well as the business needs of our clients fill these

client and detail system functionality.

As I've talked about before, part of my work in data science is large scale educational tools, including assessment-related tools. CANVAS has a bit of an issue with uploading and including images as part of submissions for quizzes, and in my work re-designing STATS 101/108 over summer we found students got quite frustrated with the process.



So, I've developed a new web application will hopefully avoid this issue by converting a publicly shared Google doc into a HTML document with images stored on my webserver for more reliable access (as opposed to being embedded inside a Google doc). Just like your Project 1 submissions, students would then just upload the HTML document. 



Why a HTML document you might ask? Well, you will see why in Monday's lecture!!!  But remember, HTML is just text! That means we can mine the text and extract a whole lot more meaningful information more reliably then if we attempted to extracted text (or images) from a PDF.



If you are still reading and you happen to have a few minutes free over the next few days and would like to help me test this web application, I would be SUPER grateful!



I've set up a ""mock"" assessment on our CANVAS page that is not worth any marks. In particular I really need to know if any mac users have problems, as we've had some issues with other applications I've developed (although never on my own mac - sigh!)



Here's the link to the assessment (with the app embedded in the instructions): https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/89757/assignments/331947



Have a great weekend regardless!

Looking for a career in the science and technology space?

Meet over 90 employers and find out more about the opportunities available 
at our 2023 STEM Career Expo!

Taking place across two days, this event will expose you to internship and 
graduate job opportunities that you didn't know existed. We have over 40 
employers in the STEM sector registered and eager to meet you in person.

Whether you are in your first or final year, start exploring a career in 
STEM and discover what opportunities are available to you. Mark this event 
in your calendar now!

Dates: Wednesday 29 and Thursday 30 March 2023
Time: 10.30am-2.30pm
Location: Engineering Atriums Levels 3 and 4, Building 401, City Campus

Who? The full list of organisations attending on each day is available on our 
website 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woTDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJdxqgqI7H7jB_hTz7~Pv9o&2=40512>. 
Registered organisations include Accenture, Akuna Capital, Energy Skills 
Aotearoa, FAST NZ, Grant Thornton, KiwiRail, Optiver, PwC, TOMRA Fresh 
Food, Windcave, and many more!

Some employers only attend one day of the expo, some attend both. Make sure 
you check the website to see if the employer you want to meet is attending 
Wednesday or Thursday (or both).

Come to the STEM Expo prepared to make an impression!

Our top tips to prepare yourself for the STEM Expo are:

- Research the organisations attending and their opportunities.
- Have an open mind and don't be afraid to ask questions. Employers often 
look for people with different background experience and transferable 
skills. Even if you're not studying engineering (for example), an 
engineering company might still be really interested in hiring you because 
of the different perspectives you can bring to their organisation. You'll 
get a feel for this by speaking to a diverse range of employers, rather 
than sticking to the companies that are obviously in your field of study.
- Clarify what you have to offer employers and build confidence in speaking 
to them by booking your place on one of our workshops 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woTDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJdxqgqI7H7jB_hTz7~Pv9o&2=40513> 
before the event to improve your networking and interviewing skills and 
reflect on your desired career direction.
- Update your CV and LinkedIn profile - we have a daily CV drop-in 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~woTDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJdxqgqI7H7jB_hTz7~Pv9o&2=40514>, 
and an online CV building tool to help.

There's no need to register, just turn up on the day. This event is 
exclusively for students at the University of Auckland, so don't forget to 
bring your student ID!

We look forward to seeing you there!

Those students who engaged with the seminar via Zoom had at times trouble following the conversation due to the audio quality in a large room when discussions are going on. So please have a look at the updated assignment instructions to help you with this assignment.

Class Rep needed

I have not received any expressions of interest. Every course has to have a class rep according to our university regulations. ¬†A class rep ensures that the student voice is heard. Please consider this role, you do not have to overthink it and it won't take much of your time. It it a good opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills and initiative which you can out on your CV. Thanks for considering this role!

Best wishes,

Hi!



I wasn't able to attend the lab today and thus couldn't get this doubt clarified. 



I just wanted to ask that like the sep argument of the paste function can the collapse also use symbols or emojis to merge two vectors? 



I tried but it didn't work for me so I was just curious if we can put any other values in that instead of a "" ""

For instance, instead of having a vector that contains 96 boolean values, is it possible to only obtain the indices of the values that turned out to be TRUE? In this specific case, the indice...

Welcome to the third week of the course, and the start of Module 2: Creating dynamic reporting systems.¬†

Here are the important notices for the week:

* Project 1 due today. Probably top of your list this week is Project 1, which is due today (Monday) 10pm. Don't forget you can submit up to three days after the due date, with a 10% penalty for each day the project is late (starting from the first minute it is late). If you have a good reason for submitting late, you can email me to ask for the penalty to be removed (this is all covered in the Course information on CANVAS). If you need help with Project 1, I am in my office until around 3pm today (room 303.320), and then after this can help via Ed Discussion/email. Don't forget there are also scheduled hours for in-person and ZOOM-based STATS 220 support in the Assistance Hub (see Support and Feedback on CANVAS, and scroll down to the bottom of the [AH information sheet is the timetable)] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNu4lOdkxddpOGJuvYko5lGJR77fR6L88wI5Es73b90/export?format=pdf).

* Lab tasks/quizzes. You will need to start running R code on your computer for the lab quizzes and should get into the habit of doing this, to better prepare for the test where you will not be able to use the ""code boxes"" from the online lab tasks. If you have any questions about lab quiz questions, you can use the private mode on Ed Discussion to ask me questions with any relevant screenshots from the lab quiz. Take your time to do these quizzes meaningfully when you have multiple attempts, as you will only have one attempt for the test.¬†

* Feedback: Don't forget you can use the feedback form on the Support and Feedback page to let me know what things are working for your learning, or suggestions for things that might help your learning (here is the [feedback form link] (https://forms.gle/scWoisM625PmhqRn9) again). For example, a student asked for me to increase the font of the code when I use RStudio in lectures, which I normally do but totally forgot to do last week and will remember to do from now on!

Well done on such a strong start to the course! We look forward to marking your Project 1 submissions and seeing all your creative outputs üòÄ

Hello,



I have written all my code but I am not sure why when I press run code in R studio, nothing is happening. It doesn't show up with error or anything, just blank. Does anyone know how to fix this?

Hi there,



Sorry I'm just confused about what ""use of indenting and white space"" means? Is it referring to a specific way of coding or how the image looks?

Is there any way to change the css formatting of the YAML information in the index.rmd/html file?



For example, I want to change the font-color of the document's title, subtitle, author, etc.







Edit: Also, is there a way to change the css properties of the code blocks. I would like to adjust the padding and borders

Hi, I am doing Part F. 



How am I supposed to add a screenshot of my folder? So far, I've copied the path to the image, but I'm worried that this will cause it to only be visible on my laptop.

Hi, I am doing Part D right now. Under the ""My meme"" section, we're supposed to use markdown to add our meme. How are we supposed to add a link to our meme? This goes for adding our GIF as well.

Business School success at international case competition

A team from the Business School won the Marshall International Case 
Competition last month. Students Emily Hacket Pain, Luke Davis, Ellie 
Cammell and Trinayan Krishnan beat stiff competition at the prestigious 
competition held at the University of Southern California. It was the 
fourth time a University of Auckland team has taken the trophy, the only 
team to have won so many times in the history of the competition.

Fantastic four finish first in international business competition

"""SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Express your interest for Class Rep, seminar attendance and topic groups: SCIGEN 399: Capstone: Science","Voting a Class Rep

All courses need to have a class rep to be able to represent students' interests and concerns. If you are interested to take on this role for SCIGEN399, please email your EOI¬†by Sunday 12 March [SCIGEN399@auckland.ac.nz ] (mailto:SCIGEN399@auckland.ac.nz)and include the following information:

* Your full name

* Your UPI

* About 100 words describing why you would be good for this role which will be shared with your class. If there are multiple volunteers it will go to a student vote.¬†

* Whether this is your first time being a class rep or if you have been a rep before

* Whether you are also a class rep for another course¬†

Class reps help facilitate the communication between university staff and students. They speak and advocate on behalf of the students of the course and are the go-to point for you with any course-related enquiries. They give feedback to the teachers and course director from the student perspective, improvements to the course, resolving issues students might face (read¬†about the role and responsibilities of a¬†[class rep] (https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/98062/pages/class-rep-101)).

Attendance

You are expected to attend and engage in the activities presented in the Tuesday workshops/seminars. Unfortunately, we were not able to schedule a later time which means those who are still overseas and waiting for their visa to come back to NZ have an early start, i.e. 4 am in China (9 am NZDT). We know that this is not ideal, nevertheless, your dedication to get up so early and join in on the discussions and group tasks is noted. Hopefully this won't be too much longer and you will be joining us on campus soon.

If you cannot attend, please let us know using the course email [SCIGEN399@auckland.ac.nz] (mailto:SCIGEN399@auckland.ac.nz) and one of the teachers will get back to you. We are here to help and support you so you can get the most out of your capstone learning.¬†

Topic Groups now set up on Canvas

You may have noticed that you are now put into groups (see under 'People') to explore a topic for your Scientific American Style journal article and presentation due end of semester. Group formation is based on students' majors and with multidisciplinarity in mind so we have a good mix of expertise in each group. As part of Allen's (week 3) and¬† Julie's (week 4) sessions, you will have opportunity to explore a group topic that interests you individually as well as a group.

To collaborate effectively, you can use the Canvas group tools¬† or other channels (e.g., discord) or MS Teams to share ideas, documents, resources etc. MS Teams would be a good choice because more and more employers and organisations are using it (collaborating on your capstone project using Teams provides you with a good employability skill). Students will be able to create their own Teams using MyHub. For more information visit ¬†[https://auckland.ac.nz/teams] (https://auckland.ac.nz/teams)

And as always, if you have any questions, please let us know.

Cheers,

Hi, can I exclude the CSS code chunk from the knitted output by using 'echo=False'?



The code still applies to the project, but the code chunk will be hidden in the output.



Or do they have to be displayed in the knitted output as well?

It says in part D to copy the code chunk: ```{r file='meme.R', eval=FALSE}``` and that the code from this file will show automatically when the file is knitted. But when I knit, I can't see any code. What could be the problem? I have double checked that the file names match. TIA :)

I'm concerned with how we can recreate an existing meme precisely if we don't know where the images used in it were sourced from. Does our meme have to look exactly the same as the one we're looking at or is it enough to make one that is similar looking?

As STATS 399 is not offered in Semester One you can enrol in SCIGEN 399 instead. This is an alternative capstone that caters to students in majors without a semester one capstone option. 


Thanks,

Hello, I was wondering if I could do another stage 3 statistics paper in semester 1 so I don't have to wait till semester 2 to do my capstone to graduate.
Is it possible if I could get permission to do this as I am currently just missing stats220 and stats399-capstone, and would rather do both papers in 1 semester?






Regards,
Matthew Sum

Anna Fergusson <a.fergusson@auckland.ac.nz>,"""msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz"" <msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz>",STATS 220: Voting for our class rep,"Kia ora Matthew
Welcome again to STATS 220. I hope you enjoyed the lectures this week and have made a start on the lab task, with the lab quiz due tonight 10pm. If you have enrolled late in the course, just reply to this email and we can sort out a later due date for you for the Lab 1A quiz. üòä
I messed up with sorting out the class reps for this semester of STATS 220. Normally, we have more students enrolled, which means we can have two class reps. But this semester the numbers are not quite high enough, so you will need to decide on only one class rep.
Thanks again to Pamela and Ashley for volunteering! Here is a link to a Google form to complete to vote on who you would like to be the class rep this semester: https://forms.gle/cKYJ8o4zC2Ks2yjy7.
Your response will be anonymous, but to ensure the voting process is fair, you will need to sign into your university gmail account (e.g. amar112@aucklanduni.ac.nz<mailto:amar112@aucklanduni.ac.nz>) and this will be used to make sure you only vote once (but neither Pamela, Ashley, or I will be able to see who you voted for).
Also, while I have you reading this email, feel free to email me back to say hi. If you also have a pet (not just cats, I like dogs too!), you could always send me a picture of them, even though they probably won‚Äôt be as cute as my cat Elliot üê±üê± If you don‚Äôt have a pet, you could always send me visualisation or graphic you‚Äôve seen recently that you thought was pretty cool.
Have a productive rest of the week, and I‚Äôll see you back in lectures next week!
NgƒÅ mihi
Anna

University of Auckland <studentinfo@auckland.ac.nz>,msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Notice of strike action 1-2 March 2023," 

 
[image: Image] 

 

This email is intended for Matthew  Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

As a continuation from last year the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and 
Public Service Association (PSA) have notified the University of further 
strike action this week by our academic and professional staff who are 
union members.

The form of the strike will be a work stoppage from 1.30pm on Wednesday 1 
March to 12.30pm on Thursday 2 March 2023.

It is disappointing that this latest strike action will once again impact 
the learning experience of our students, particularly in the first week of 
the new semester. We are also conscious that many staff, students and 
whanau are still struggling to get back on their feet following the recent 
severe weather events.

The University is working hard to ensure that disruptions are minimised as 
much as possible, although we expect this action will affect the delivery 
of some courses. Information will be updated on your Canvas course pages up 
to and during the 23 hours of the strike action.

Please check Canvas regularly, in particular before you come onto campus on 
Wednesday morning.

Go to Canvas 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wohDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yJrxqgqI7H7jB9NTz7~Pv_E&2=40503>
.

Our campuses will be fully open for the duration of the strike, and all 
student services and events will be available as usual

Hey Bruno,
Yes I tried to enroll for SCIGEN399 but there was a conflict with stats220 so I couldn't enrol for SCIGEN399.
Is it possible to bypass this conflict?

"""STATS 220: Data Technologies"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Week 1 notices: STATS 220: Data Technologies,"Kia ora tatou

Welcome again to the first week of STATS 220! In future, I'll be sending out these notices on Monday.

It was great to see so many of you at lectures this week and speak to some of you in person. I will try to continue to get around the lecture theatre to chat with more of you before each lecture starts! Innocenter and Justin also look forward to meeting you tomorrow if you attend the drop-in lab sessions üòÄ

Just to clarify, the times for the drop-in lab sessions are Wednesday 9am (room 303S-175) and 12pm (room 303S-B75). A ZOOM-based drop-in lab session will be offered on Wednesday for students overseas or who can't make it into campus from 5:30pm to 7:30pm ([ZOOM link] (https://auckland.zoom.us/j/97293818919?pwd=c3VOaGxBZ1VwL1VBY2hLb2haTVBkQT09)).

Waipapa Taumata Rau |University of Auckland has received notice from the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) that a strike action will take place from Wednesday 1:30pm until Thursday 12:30pm involving some staff who are union members who will not be available or working during this time. The STATS 220 drop-in sessions scheduled for Wednesday will occur as scheduled and are not affected by the strike action.

Here are the notices for the week:

* Review the last few slides of Lecture 1A.2 as I ran out of time to talk about these in the lecture today (you can find these under the¬†Module resources¬†tab).

* The first lab quiz (based on Lab task 1A) is due¬†Wednesday 10pm.

* In the¬†Course information tab, there is information about penalties for late submissions. Essentially, tasks/projects remain open for three days after the due date, if you need longer to complete them (rather than requesting an extension). However, a late penalty will be applied per day, and you will need to email me if you have a good reason for submitting late, for these penalties to be removed üòÄ

* Project 1 is available under the¬†Module resources tab.

* To get going with Project 1, set up a Github Account, and download and install R and RStudio (get along to the lab sessions to get help with any of this).

Thank you¬†to all the students who have emailed me to introduce themselves and let me know how I can help them with their learning this semester. Feel free to send me an email to say kia ora or if you have any questions (or you can use Ed Discussion, it's just me answering questions on there too!)

Have a great rest of the first week of the semester, and see you back in lectures again next week.

NgƒÅ mihi

Will the pipe override the first argument or no? Just because in the lab it says if you don't give a name, the code will assume it's the one in order. Does the code assuming the name only apply when we use piping too?

Hi Matthew, 


As STATS 399 is not offered in Semester One you can enrol in SCIGEN 399 instead. This is an alternative capstone that caters to students in majors without a semester one capstone option. 


Thanks,

Hello, I was wondering if I could do another stage 3 statistics paper in semester 1 so I don't have to wait till semester 2 to do my capstone to graduate.
Is it possible if I could get permission to do this as I am currently just missing stats220 and stats399-capstone, and would rather do both papers in 1 semester?

Matthew Sum

If all the programme requirements are satisfied, you can complete the programme. I don‚Äôt know how long it take to get the official certificate/graduation and, the science faculty or graduation office will assist you better on this matter.

Hello Kate,
Just double checking,
So I can graduate in semester 1 if I meet all the program requirements without completing the capstone.
Rather using stats326 as a replacement to the capstone.

Hope you enjoy the nice weather and have some fun after your hard work on summer school.¬† Thank you all for taking the course, and I hope you learn the skills that you need for your future work. I have just received the SET report, and really appreciate the comments that some of your provided. Most of you find this course useful and it covers the modelling techniques that you will need to use in future. This is indeed my goal for teaching this course, and thank you.¬†

For the specific comments, here are my thoughts.¬†

1. More case studies: we will explore the possibility to add more case studies, and provide the necessary R-code.¬†

2. The handout 15 and handout 16 are too long: summer school is always fast. It will be the case that for some of the materials, you will only have 1-2 days to revise before the due date. This is mainly b/c for summer school, we only have 6 weeks within which we have lots of public holidays (and unexpected events in this year). For normal semester, we will have more time for you to revise before due date of each assignment/quiz. We will be exploring to add sub-sessions for handout 15 and handout 16 so that each of those can seem to be shorter.¬†

¬†

Thank you for taking the course with us, and I wish you very best of the luck for your future work and study.¬†

If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

With today's more settled weather, the safety and logistical concerns that 
I outlined yesterday have eased significantly. The Incident Management Team 
(IMT) advises that our campuses are in good shape following the cyclone, 
and the weather warnings for the region have been lifted.

I have therefore made the decision that the University can return to normal 
operations on all our campuses from tomorrow, Thursday 16 February.

Quarter One teaching and learning will remain online for the rest of this 
week; however, there will be some limited exceptions determined by 
faculties where needed.

Student Hubs, libraries, retail outlets, cafes and student commons and 
study spaces will reopen tomorrow, and events may proceed on campus. For 
updates on the re-opening plans for other student services, please check 
the Severe weather in Auckland: Cyclone Gabrielle page 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wpXDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yKhxqgqI7H7jB85Tz7~Pv~w&2=40460>
.

I want to acknowledge and thank the many University staff who have worked 
tirelessly in recent weeks to respond to the extraordinary weather events - 
from assessing damage, managing the clean-up, keeping our campuses safe and 
secure, and supporting each other and our students. I know many of you have 
also been helping in your local communities.

NgƒÅ mihi nui ki a koe. Thank you all,

Kia kaha,

This email is intended for Matthew  Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

With Cyclone Gabrielle moving down the East Coast of the North Island, it 
appears the worst of the severe weather in Auckland and Northland is now 
behind us, although strong wind warnings remain in place for today. I hope 
you and your whƒÅnau are safe and well.

Official reports today indicate significant storm damage across the region, 
with numerous slips, road closures, power outages and surface flooding. The 
advice from Auckland Emergency Management (AEM) is to travel only if 
necessary while debris is cleared from roads. Public transport is also 
facing delays and service suspensions.

Given the safety and logistical concerns, I am keen to give staff and 
students clarity and certainty in their planning. The Strategic Response 
Team (SRT) has made the decision that the University will remain in online 
delivery mode for the remainder of this week. At this point, we expect to 
return to full on-campus delivery from Monday 20 February.

The settings that were communicated last Friday 10 February will remain in 
place for the rest of the week. More information is available on the 
University's website, but briefly these settings are:

   - All staff and students should continue working and studying from home 
   this week and prepare to return to campus next Monday, 20 February, unless 
   they are required on-campus from Saturday 18 February to deliver or receive 
   student services (see below). 
   - Student services will be delivered remotely for the remainder of this 
   week, including Student Hubs, health and counselling services, online 
   library services and IT support. They will reopen for in-person on-campus 
   delivery from Saturday 18 February. 
   - All services that are unable to operate in online mode will be closed 
   for the remainder of this week and will reopen for in-person on-campus 
   delivery from Saturday 18 February. 
   - Student accommodation will remain open. 
   - Examinations and teaching scheduled for this week will be held online 
   for the entire week. 

For more detailed information, please see Severe weather in Auckland:

My name is Rachel Fewster and I'll be one of your instructors for the STATS 399 capstone in Semester 2.

I've just published this course briefly on Canvas so that I can send out an announcement. I'll unpublish it again after the announcement is sent.

Unfortunately the timetable for this course was not set up correctly, and we only discovered the error last week. The Friday 4-6pm stream is now¬†closed and replaced by a Wednesday 8-10am stream. There are also other streams now open that were not available when you enrolled.

Please check your timetable and ensure you are in the stream you want to be in. You'll be expected to attend your stream in person, so it's important that the timing works for you. Here are the four options:

* Tue 10am-12pm 303-B07

* Tue 4pm-6pm ¬†303-G14 (this stream will probably have an online option, but we will confirm this closer to the time)

* Wed 8am-10am 114-G14

* Wed 12pm-2pm 303-G14

If you were previously in the Friday 4-6pm stream, you should have been moved to a different one (please check this). If you want to change your stream, do it quickly as some of them are getting close to capacity.¬†

Apologies for any inconvenience this error may have caused. Please note that the course will now be unpublished on Canvas and there will probably be no further announcements until the course is due to start.

I'm looking forward to working with you in Semester 2!
Best wishes,

STATS 330 on Piazza <no-reply@piazza.com>,msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Why would we use 2^k - 1 rather than just 2^k?,"Your classmate posted a new Question. 

Why would we use 2^k - 1 rather than just 2^k?

Hi, I was quite confused about this question from the 2019 S1 exam:



I don't see any reason to subtract 1?

If we let the 5 explanatory variables be $$a,b,c,d,e$$ then I'm pretty sure we can list 32 models with an intercept, not 31:

1. $$\beta_0$$
2. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a$$
3. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b$$
4. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times c$$
5. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times d$$
6. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times e$$
7. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b$$
8. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times c$$
9. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times d$$
10. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times e$$
11. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times c$$
12. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times d$$
13. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times e$$
14. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times c + \beta_2 \times d$$
15. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times c + \beta_2 \times e$$
16. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times d + \beta_2 \times e$$
17. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times c$$
18. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times d$$
19. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times e$$
20. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times d$$
21. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times e$$
22. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times d + \beta_3 \times e$$
23. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times d$$
24. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times e$$
25. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times d + \beta_3 \times e$$
26. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times c + \beta_2 \times d + \beta_3 \times e$$
27. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times c + \beta_4 \times d$$
28. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times c + \beta_4 \times e$$
29. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times d + \beta_4 \times e$$
30. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times d + \beta_4 \times e$$
31. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times b + \beta_2 \times c + \beta_3 \times d + \beta_4 \times e$$
32. $$\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times a + \beta_2 \times b + \beta_3 \times c + \beta_4 \times d + \beta_5 \times e$$


Obviously there are more elegant ways to do this proof, but this seems to quite conclusively show there are 32 possible models that include an intercept by listing all of them? Why then would the answers say there are 31?

(It's possible that the formula was meant to be written $$2^{k-1}$$ rather than $$2^k - 1$$, as we would usually take $$k$$ to be the number of parameters rather than the number of variables, and if we say that we must include the intercept then we have $$k-1$$ parameters that each be included or excluded (as we are fixing the intercept to be included). In this case we would have $$k=6$$ thus $$2^{k-1} = 2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32$$, which would be the correct answer if my list of possible models is correct. But if this is the case, the formula has been entered into the answer sheet incorrectly and subsequently used to calculate an incorrect answer.

Alternatively, it's possible that the question was not including the null model as a possible model that might be fitted - but why not? In handout 15 we saw that the null model was one of the top models listed by a BIC dredge, which suggests that the null model is one of the models fitted and considered in an exhaustive method model search).

University of Auckland <studentinfo@auckland.ac.nz>,msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,Vice-Chancellor's Update | Friday 10 February," 

 
[image: Image] 

 

This email is intended for Matthew  Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

You will have seen news of the approaching Cyclone Gabrielle, which is 
expected to bring another bout of severe weather to the upper North Island 
from Sunday 12 February. The state of emergency in the Auckland region has 
also been extended by seven days. From our experience of the storm two 
weeks ago, we are anticipating further disruption to our campuses, and to 
roads and services in the region.

The Incident Management Team (IMT) and Strategic Response Team (SRT) met 
this morning to determine our response and preparation for the imminent 
cyclone. As always, the health and safety of our University community is 
our priority.

Given the potential severity of the expected storm, SRT and IMT advice is 
that as few people as possible should be on our campuses early next week. 
SRT has therefore made the decision that the University will move to online 
delivery on Monday 13 February and Tuesday 14 February. SRT will review 
this setting on Tuesday.

All staff should work from home on Monday and Tuesday, the only exceptions 
being staff whose roles are essential for the continuity of critical campus 
operations and infrastructure. This includes those working in student 
accommodation, animal welfare and critical research.

Student services

Student services will be delivered remotely wherever possible, including 
Student Hubs, health and counselling services, online library services and 
IT support.

All services that are unable to move to online mode will be closed on 
Monday and Tuesday. This includes retail outlets, cafes, the Recreation 
Centre, events, and any other physical spaces on campus such as libraries, 
student commons and study spaces.

Student accommodation will remain open; however we are advising students 
who were planning to move in on Monday and Tuesday to delay their arrival 
if possible.

All buildings on campus will be locked from Sunday evening but will be 
accessible by swipe card.

Examinations and teaching

Examinations and teaching scheduled for next week will now be held online. 
We are informing all participating students of this change to give them 
certainty and plenty of time to prepare. Details of alternative teaching 
arrangements will be available on Canvas.

Updates

The University will continue to follow the guidance of Auckland Emergency 
Management (AEM) as the storm approaches. If the situation deteriorates 
further, and we are required to restrict campus access fully or extend the 
working from home period, communications will be circulated as soon as 
possible via all-staff and all-student emails, notices on the main website, 
social media, and the staff intranet. Please look out for further updates 
over the weekend and into next week. The Notice page will be updated as 
more information comes to hand.

<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wpvDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yK5xqgqI7H7jB~oTz7~Pv8h&2=40434>

I encourage you to use today to prepare for working and studying from home 
and think about what you need to take home with you before the weekend. The 
GetReady website also provides useful tips for how you can prepare at home 
for an approaching storm.

GetReady 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wpvDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yK5xqgqI7H7jB~oTz7~Pv8h&2=40435>

I know this latest disruption will be concerning for all of you, 
particularly after the events of the past few weeks. However, we have been 
in this situation before and we know we can shift to online delivery 
quickly and efficiently. The priority is of course to stay safe and well 
during this period of severe weather.

Turkey and Syria

I know many of you will be concerned about the deepening crisis in Turkey 
and Syria following the devastating earthquake. Our thoughts are with our 
students and staff from the affected regions, and those who have family and 
friends there. If you need support, please contact Te Papa Manaaki, Campus 
Care

¬†

A3 marks are posted. Great work in general, and here are the comments

1. Many students forgot that weathersit is a factor variable and thus got the equation for the mean of the final model incorrect.¬†

2. For question 2.5, a range of mistakes were made, such as dredging GAMs and forgetting to rank by BIC.¬†

3. Many students didn't check the goodness of fit (e.g., didn't include the chi-square test,¬† didn't include the residual plots, or no comments) .

4. When writing the equations: some forgot to define the distribution of the outcome, and many of them defined the NB model with a Poisson distribution.

1. Causal diagram: You can draw manually and take a photo. Alternatively, you can use the below code and make choice of whether causal1 or causal2 should be used. ¬†I.e., between causal1 and causal2 (highlighted in yellow) below, only one of them is correct. Replace the words highlighted in green with the one you choose (e.g., if you choose causal2, then the current code is the one you will use. If you choose causal1, then you replace the words highlighted in green to be causal1).¬†

3. For comparison/interpretation. For example, for the below model that I have, I have interactions b/w treatment and diabetes and the interaction between ejection fraction and treatment. Therefore, ¬†I will need to see the treatment effect for each value of ejection fraction among people with diabetes and without diabetes. E.g., 1) when diabetes=0, ejf_per=3, estimate the treatment effects; 2) when diabetes=0, elf_per=4, estimate treatment effects, etc. The code to achieve this is:¬†

Binomial Distribution GLM Offset Procedure - Not Necessary?  (2/7/2023, 6:04:02 PM)

Hi there,Hoping to clarify my understanding of constructing a binomial GLM model with a rate response in R. Is it correct that there is no need for an offset parameter within the GLM function (i.e., a 'offset=()' term) if we want to model a rate, as the rate is already inherent within the model function when we specify 'family=binomial' in our GLM, as takes into account the total number of trials and the other characteristics of a binomial model?If this is not the case, what is the best practice to model a rate within a binomial GLM in R?Cheers & TIA.

This email is intended for Matthew  Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

Your Summer School exams start soon and it is time to start getting 
prepared.

When are my exams?

You can view your exam timetable on Student Services Online 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wp~Dv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLJxqgqI7H7jB_ITz7~Pv9B&2=40390>
.

It is important that you double-check the:

   - Date of your exam 
   - Time of your exam 
   - Location of your exam 
   - How your exam is being delivered (exam mode) 

If you miss your exam, a DNS grade is put on your transcript. DNS means Did 
Not Sit.

Please note, all exam start times are listed in New Zealand time.

This means if you're in a different time zone, you will need to change the 
New Zealand times listed into your local time to know when your exam starts.

How do I access my exam?

In Summer School 2023, most exams are online and non-invigilated. However, 
some exams are invigilated and take place in person on campus or online 
using digital invigilation.

There are four different modes of exams and how you access your exam 
depends on the exam mode. To check the mode of your exam, you can view the 
full exam timetable at Exam timetable 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wp~Dv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLJxqgqI7H7jB_ITz7~Pv9B&2=40391>

Hi just wondering how we can compare the mean and variance for a poisson model to check our assumption. Should we use a simulation to achieve this?

Necessary to Use Simulation in Assignment 3?  (2/1/2023, 10:28:54 PM)

Hi,

For this assignment is it necessary or expected that we use simulations in our solutions?
I understand that most of the work we do are based on what we already learnt before the test as well, so I was checking if I finished most questions (except perhaps Q1 part 7) without simulations, does it sound about right?

If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

We have just received confirmation from the Ministry of Education that the 
official Direction received on Monday for schools and other education 
providers to close until next Tuesday 7 February has now been lifted. This 
takes effect from today, Wednesday 1 February.

To avoid further disruption at a time when many of our students and staff 
are dealing with the aftermath of the storms, the University's position 
will remain unchanged. No-one is expected to return to campus until next 
Tuesday 7 February unless they desire, and it is safe to do so. In the 
meantime, our campuses are open including student hubs, health services, 
libraries, pharmacy and retail outlets.

Where it is necessary and practicable, faculties have the discretion to 
return to on-campus teaching and learning from tomorrow (Thursday 2 
February) if that is their preference. Please note that Summer Start will 
remain online until next Tuesday.

We will provide more information as it comes to hand.

Our campuses

The storm overnight was less impactful than the severe weather last Friday, 
and our campuses are in good shape. All students and staff are safe, 
although some have experienced flooding in their homes and have been 
temporarily displaced. I'm pleased to report that all have found 
alternative accommodation.

Please visit the official notice page on the website for more information, 
as some buildings will have localised areas closed for repairs.

Hi,In relation to Q1(5), I just wondering and wanting to confirm that in Q1(5), that modifying 'the above Poisson glm model' is referring to the model fitted in Q1(3)? (i.e., the GLM) Or, is it meant to be about modifying the Poisson gam model from Q1(4)?Am just a bit confused as the relationship we're wanting to reflect (he relationship between the log of the expected number of the chromosomal abnormalities and the total amount of dose in Grays) in Q1(5) is more akin to our model in Q1(4), but is mentioning a GLM (like in Q1(3)), rather than the GAM in Q1(4).Thanks so much!

Today's office hour will be online via zoom as announced in my earlier email. Since I just received a text from my kid's school holiday program, I will have to pick him up before 3pm due to bad predicted weather. Therefore, my office hour today will be from 2:00pm to 2:30pm, and then from 3:30pm to 4:00pm. If none of the time slot works for you, please email me and we can setup a time that fits us all.

Given the current stress many of you have faced, I have decided to make question 1.7 (i.e., Estimate the total amount of dose in Grays at which the rate of chromosomal abnormalities per 100 cell is 0.05 and provide its 95% confidence interval.)¬†to be a bonus question. In other words, the max amount of marks will be 90 points for assignment 3. If you decided to do question 1.7, your final grade will be marks (from other questions)+marks (from 1.7). If this is larger than 90, then you will get 90 (i.e., full marks). If you decided to not do question 1.7, you final grade will be marks from all the other questions that you have answered.¬†Hope this will ease some of the stress that you face.¬†

Kia ora Matthew,

Teaching this week

A short while ago we received a directive from the Ministry of Education 
that schools, kura, early learning services and tertiary institutions in 
the Auckland region (Wellsford to Pukekohe) must close for physical 
attendance and instruction until 7 February 2023.

This decision follows a request from the National Emergency Management 
Agency (NEMA) for people in the Auckland region to stay at home during the 
current crisis, which will help minimise traffic movement on Auckland roads 
while vital infrastructure is urgently repaired.

What this means for the University is that we are facing some restrictions. 
Our campuses remain open, however please note the following:

   - Face-to-face teaching and learning are not permitted until 7 February 
   2023. 
   - Distance and online learning can take place and is encouraged wherever 
   possible. 
   - Staff may go onto our campuses to provide online learning, maintain 
   essential equipment and research, check on animals, and any other essential 
   activities. 
   - There are no restrictions on student accommodation, including travel 
   to accommodation, but please take care while travelling and follow NEMA 
   advice prior to any travel. 
   - On-campus services, including health services, libraries, pharmacy, 
   and retail outlets will remain open. 

This rapid transition to online learning, at such short notice, is not 
ideal however we have been in similar situations before during the 
pandemic. To help teaching staff determine what is needed without undue 
pressure, and to help them make the transition successfully, we are 
designating tomorrow, Tuesday 31 January, as a non-teaching day for those 
who need it. Anyone who can shift to online teaching immediately should do 
so.

If you are a student currently enrolled, please wait to hear directly from 
your lecturer about this transition and how it will affect your schedule.

We will provide further updates as information comes to hand.

Update on our campuses

As damage assessment and clean-up efforts continue - even while Auckland 
braces itself for more bad weather this week - I hope you and your friends 
and whƒÅnau are staying safe and well. I have heard many accounts of 
neighbours and communities pitching in to help those most in need, and I 
know some of you are involved in this remarkable response. On behalf of our 
University community, ngƒÅ mihi nui ki a koutou katoa. Thank you all.

In my message on Saturday, I said I would provide an update on the status 
of our campuses and buildings. I am pleased to report that the University 
is in good shape generally, however a small number of rooms and ground 
floor/basement areas are still drying out and will be inaccessible for at 
least a few more days. The full list of affected areas is available on the 
Response to the extreme weather in Auckland page on the main website, where 
we also provide information about support services for students and staff, 
and regular updates.

<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqRDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLbxqgqI7H7jB_sTz7~Pv9l&2=40373>

This has been a rapidly evolving situation, and I appreciate your patience 
as we work to provide the most current and clear communications we can. 
Many thanks as well to the teams across our campuses who have been working 
to ensure the safety of our students and staff, and business continuity for 
the University.

NgƒÅ mihi nui,

[image: Image] 

 

This email is intended for Matthew  Sum (Username: msum500).
If you received this email in error, please advise us by return email.

Kia ora Matthew,

It is clear the extraordinary rainfall yesterday and overnight has caused 
severe damage and disruption to large areas of the city and wider TƒÅmaki 
Makaurau region. No doubt many of you will have been affected. I hope you 
and your whƒÅnau are keeping well.

If you have been affected and need support, here are some resources within 
the University and across Auckland that are available to you:

   - If you need urgent accommodation assistance, phone 0800 22 22 00. 
   - If you need Ministry of Social Development welfare assistance as a 
   result of the flooding, please call 0800 400 100. 
   - Three current Civil Defense Centres have been established: 
   - 
      - West: St. Leonards Road School, 15 Saint Leonards Road, Kelston 
      - North: Massey University Albany Campus, Sir Neil Walters Lecture 
      Theatre, Massey University East Precinct, Albany Expressway SH17 
      - South: Mana Tukutuku, 32 Riverton Drive, Randwick Park 
   - If you need advice and support from the University, visit the website 
   for a wide range of services across personal, academic and learning, 
   financial and tech support are available. For more information, please see Student 
   support 
   <https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqTDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLdxqgqI7H7jB_gTz7~Pv9p&2=40372>
   . 

While our campuses weren't spared from the deluge, I am pleased to report 
staff and students have remained safe. Some of our buildings have been 
inundated at ground floor levels, including the Recreation Centre on 
Stanley Street which is closed until at least Tuesday, and there are 
reports of leaks in others which are being investigated. There have also 
been temporary power and network service outages to some buildings. The 
latest update from the Incident Management Team handling the University's 
response is that issues are being assessed for severity and resolved based 
on priorities. Please be aware that many of our teams and contractor 
resources are currently stretched in Auckland and we ask for patience as 
the problems are worked through.

Our teams have been working tirelessly overnight and today to assess the 
damage, manage the clean-up and communicate with those affected. Thank you 
to everyone involved in this.

It is likely that access to some buildings on the City Campus will be 
restricted next week. I will provide an update on Monday with the full 
details of any affected areas across all campuses so that staff and 
students can make decisions well in advance of the return to work and study 
on Tuesday 31 January 2023.

In the meantime, the state of emergency in Auckland remains in place, and 
the advice is to stay off the roads. This will help the emergency response 
teams working across the city and region. Please only come onto campus over 
the weekend if it is absolutely essential.

We've established an incident page on our website that will be updated 
regularly with alerts, building closures, and other relevant news. In the 
meantime, please continue to stay safe and follow guidance from Auckland 
Emergency Management. For more information, please see Response to the 
extreme weather in Auckland

"""STATS 330: Statistical Modelling"" <notifications@instructure.com>",msum500@aucklanduni.ac.nz,flood in Auckland: STATS 330: Statistical Modelling,"Dear all,

Those of you in Auckland know that we've experienced torrential rain and flooding over the last 24 hours. First and foremost, I hope everyone is doing okay. This has been a traumatic event for many people, and some of you will still be suffering from the stresses of water damage and clean-up.

Naturally, we can offer extensions to those who have been affected by the events. Right at the moment I'm waiting for more information about whether these are going to be handled at University level or just on a one-by-one basis for affected students. I'll send out another announcement when I know more.

For the moment, I suggest that if you have been affected, just focus on what you need to do for the moment to keep yourselves safe and comfortable. If it turns out later that we'll be handling extensions on a one-by-one basis, please get in touch at that stage.

Watch out for another announcement when we've heard back about the University-level response plan. Meanwhile, stay safe, and my sincere sympathies to those who have suffered any damage or trauma.

Best wishes,
Yalu

A list of invigilated exams (modes B, C, and D) will be stated in the 
'Mode' column in the published exam timetable. Please ensure that you read 
your exam timetable carefully. This is because:

   - You must attend your exam 
   - Sit your exam in the correct mode 

You'll need to plan all your personal activities around the exam period as 
exams are compulsory at the University. If you miss sitting your exam by 
mixing up the time, date or location, your grade will be recorded as DNS 
(did not sit).

Exams will take place across two sessions. You will either have an exam in 
the afternoon at 12.30pm or in the evening at 5pm.

Your exams will be scheduled between Monday 13 February and Wednesday 15 
February 2023.

If an exam conflicts with other commitments, please check the criteria 
online for alternative exam times or locations. Applications to move an 
exam time must be made by Thursday 29 September 2022.

For more information, please visit Alternative times for exams 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvNy~wqfDv8S~xb~Gv_Y~yLpxqgqI7H7jB9ITz7~Pv_B&2=39976>
.

Remote students studying offshore

Please note, all exam start times are listed as New Zealand Standard Time 
(NZST).

If you are located in a different time zone you will need to note down what 
time this is in your location.

If you are located in a different time zone and your exam falls between 
10pm and 6am local time, you are not expected to sit your exam during these 
hours. To request that your exam time be moved within daytime hours in your 
location, you must contact us no later than Tuesday 31 January 2023. You 
can do this by emailing alternative_exams@auckland.ac.nz.

Make sure that you carefully read the Exam instructions and regulations

Hi,

For this question we are asked to explain why¬†log(ment + 1) is used instead of¬†ment.

I understand the idea of using log to make a right-skewed distribution more symmetrical, but what is the best explanation for this?

How to calculate GOF for sparse poisson distribution data?  (1/20/2023, 5:06:21 PM)

Hi there,

As a Chisq based p-value test is not appropriate when the data is sparse, for binomial, a ""hltest"" is used instead. But I don't know when it comes to poisson distribution, what should we use? I tried ""hltest"", but R says it's only for binomial regression.

Assignment 2  (1/18/2023, 5:56:18 PM)

Hi!

The variable PeopleHousehold is stated as binary in Assignment 2 (page 3), should it be numeric instead?

Proportion of Magnitude Greater Than 3  (1/18/2023, 10:35:24 PM)

Following the same question as @62 about the threshold of ""good model"", if for example we see a reasonable proportion of Pearson or deviance residuals being large (i.e. magnitude greater than 3) can we directly invalidate the corresponding model? E.g. Would 30% of the residuals being greater than 3 in magnitude be a sufficient issue for goodness-of-fit?

If other conditions including ""mean being around 0"" and ""constant variance"" and ""patternless"" seem to be met, but this assumption is violated, can we invalidate the model directly?

Thanks in advance!

Assumptions to Use ANOVA in Handout 8?  (1/18/2023, 10:30:03 PM)

Hi, for using ANOVA to compare model fits as per below, as the test is ""chisq"" do we need the condition that deviance is chi-square distributed? This is regarding parameter values being large for Poisson and binomial distributions.


Suppose we cannot use test = ""chisq"" what are alternatives to test and compare two model fits?

Thanks in advance!

Hi, the question may sound silly, but in H6 we mentioned there is a dotted line representing log(ÀÜ¬µi) = log(5) in Possion. ¬†Where is the number 5 come from? ¬†What is the difference between the points on both sides of the dotted line?

For the purposes of question 1a, does ""goodness of fit"" statistics refer just the p-value obtained from the deviance chisq test (and in this case do we need to check if the data are sparse?), or are there other statistics we should be calculating and comparing here e.g. deviance and log-likelihood?

Mistake in Answers for Assignment 1  (1/17/2023, 8:42:05 PM)

Hi there,¬†

After looking at the answers posted for Assignment 1 I was worried since I seemed to get all my percentages wrong for my interpretations, but on closer inspection I think that it may be a mistake in the model answers and not my own answers.¬†





Am I right in saying that the highlighted code is wrong, since we should minus one from the exponentiated coefficients before multiplying by 100? i.e.,¬†


round(100*(exp(coefficients(fit2))-1),2)

and not


round(100*exp(coefficients(fit2))-1,2)

Thanks!

Residual plots for poisson and quasi-poisson models

Hi there, I'm a bit confused here. In handout 7, it says R calculates pearson residual the same for quasi-poisson and poisson models. But why we still go ahead and plot the person residuals for the quasi-poisson model and furthermore made the conclusion that quasi-poisson was not appropriate when the residual plot was the same as the poisson model? And in the end of the handout 7, it again suggests that residual plot doesn't work for poisson models?
Thanks!

Interpret point estimates or confidence intervals?  (1/11/2023, 12:03:05 PM)

Hi, the assignment instructions only say to print the summary() output and include ""an interpretation of the coefficients estimated by your model."" However, the summary output contains only point estimates on the log scale.

For these interpretations, should we
- back-transform a confidence interval and interpret that,
- back-transform just the point estimates and use those, or
- interpret the log-scale point estimates?

Thanks!

Hi, I understand why the quiz doesn't allow us to see which specific questions we got right or wrong, or the answers to those we got wrong. However, would it be possible to at least show the numerical score to see if we have to re-attempt it?

That is, could we please see whether we got questions wrong? (I understand why we can't see which individual questions that might be or the answers thereto)

normal distribution on linear regression  (1/6/2023, 2:35:38 PM)

I'm a bit confused on what the normal distribution of this linear regression plot indicates. The lecturer was talking about how it represents the means and is stretched out to show the variance but I don't understand how it can represent different means when the plot is numeric score vs conc. If anyone could put it into simple terms that would be great!

Student ID: 452608588

Re:  Alleged Misconduct, Semester Two 2022 Examinations

I am writing regarding your suspected academic misconduct in the final examination for GEOG 205. This situation came to our attention after the examiner for this course noticed a high similarity index, flagged by Turnitin indicating that this assessment contained plagiarism.

Based on the evidence provided by the examiner and taking account of the response you provided when notified of this allegation, the University has determined that your actions do constitute academic misconduct.  The penalty for this misconduct is:
1. A reduction in your examination mark
   Reduction of 2.7 marks from your final exam.


In addition, this decision will be recorded in the Academic Integrity Management System.

The basis for this decision was the similarity between parts of your final examination and other sources which indicated that you were not the author of those parts. Plagiarism is about using other people‚Äôs work without proper acknowledgement. If a student copies material from lecture notes, readings or other sources and then reproduces it in an assignment or examination without proper acknowledgement, that is plagiarism, whether the material is copied directly from the source or copied into handwritten notes that are then reproduced from memory.

As described in the Student Academic Conduct Statute you have 20 working days in which to request a review of this decision.  You must state your grounds for review and provide evidence to support your request.  If you wish to do so, please place your request via this link: https://uoa-advocate.symplicity.com/u/tnjbmVKm.  

If you request a review, you are encouraged to seek support from the AUSA Student Advocacy service.  You can contact this service by emailing advocacy@ausa.org.nz or through the AUSA Advocacy website.

I recommend that you reflect on this situation and ensure that you do not breach the University‚Äôs assessment or other academic integrity requirements in the future. If any of our requirements are unclear to you, you are welcome to re-acquaint yourself by undertaking the Academic Integrity module at https://www.academicintegrity.auckland.ac.nz/.

Kia ora koutou

We understand many students are concerned about delayed exam results. It is 
unfortunate that the current strike action by the Tertiary Education Union 
(TEU), with whom the University continues to engage in good faith, is 
spilling over into your own personal and professional lives.

We are doing everything we can to minimise any delays to ensure you receive 
your exam results. Many courses have already been updated, however we 
acknowledge that there are significant delays for some students due to the 
strike action.

Please be assured your exam results are a priority to us and we will 
process all results as quickly as possible, within the constraints of the 
current strike. We will contact individual students who are impacted by the 
strike action this week, and will outline the steps we are taking to 
resolve this issue in your best interests.

Kia ora Matthew,

Career Development and Employability Services brings employers to you.

We're trialling a selection of new workshop topics and would love to know 
what you think!

For a limited time from 15 November, we're putting on a series of workshops 
with new topics. You've already missed some of our workshops, but there's 
still an opportunity to take part!

These are the subjects we'll be exploring in the next week:

   - Pacific students: Why your Pacific-ness matters in the world of work 
   with Sela Pole-Fehoko (On campus: 22, and 29 November 2022) 
   - What do I really want? With Liudmyla Beraud (On campus: 23 November) 
   - Entering the workforce with Lorraine Henry (On campus: 24 November) 
   - The trouble with passion with Liudmyla Beraud (On campus: 29 November) 

We'd love to get your feedback on these new workshop topics. Should they 
stay in our workshop rotation for 2023 or should they go?

To help us make this decision, register for one (or more) of the workshops. 
After you attend, we'll send you a short survey to complete. Once you've 
submitted your feedback via the survey, you'll be entered into a draw to 
win a $30 Countdown voucher. The winner will be drawn and notified by Friday 
9 December 2022.

Get free career advice AND win a $30 voucher - it's a win-win situation!

We're trialling a selection of new workshop topics and would love to know 
what you think!

For a limited time from 15 November, we're putting on a series of workshops 
with new topics. These are the subjects we'll be exploring:

   - Pacific students: Why your Pacific-ness matters in the world of work 
   with Sela Pole-Fehoko (On campus: 15, 22, and 29 November 2022) 
   - Succeeding in the workplace with Sam Standley (via Zoom: 15 November) 
   - Want fulfilling work that uses your potential? Find your gifts and 
   build your career around them with Liz Barry (On campus: 16 November) 
   - What do I really want? With Liudmyla Beraud (On campus: 23 November) 
   - The trouble with passion with Liudmyla Beraud (On campus: 29 November) 

We'd love to get your feedback on these new workshop topics. Should they 
stay in our workshop rotation for 2023 or should they go?

To help us make this decision, register for one (or more) of the workshops. 
After you attend, we'll send you a short survey to complete. Once you've 
submitted your feedback via the survey, you'll be entered into a draw to 
win a $30 Countdown voucher. The winner will be drawn and notified by Friday 
9 December 2022.

my recommendations for teenagers in NZ would be...blah blah blah... and then also write I would proceed with cation if part of this population as the results may differ for you or something along the lines of that?

Just wondering for this question from a past exam:
""Discuss why people‚Äôs participation in environmental management should be seen as a process rather than an outcome.""
is it wanting us to talk about how you should focus on the process rather then the outcome?
and if i interpret the question like this but it has a different meaning will get the whole essay wrong?

Hi, would the mode also be a correct answer as it is the most common therefore more representative of average Kiwis than the mean?

exam essay structure  (11/8/2022, 1:35:10 PM)

Hi,
I'm a bit worried about trying to finish 3 essays within the allocated time. I was wondering what's being expected of us in terms of exam essay structure.

Would it be it sufficient in our intro to just include our thesis statement and maybe a sentence or two explaining the main points we are going to cover? Should we be aim to include at least three main points to answer each question? Lastly, how substantive does our conclusion have to be?

Sorry for so many questions! Any insight would be really helpful.
Thanks in advance!

Exam question  (11/8/2022, 11:49:07 AM)

Just want to clarify if a question is perhaps meant for Emmas section and we find material from JC or Megs section that we find to be relevant are we able to just write about that or do we need to only write about material from the particular section?

Go to https://piazza.com/class?cid=la7dl0ga6p82ss&nid=l50otpqixik44g&token=r3Qei4Lc4Tq to view.

JCs and Emma's past questions  (11/8/2022, 11:39:07 AM)

Kia ora, just reposting a question sent to me via email: 

Q: ""are there any questions in the 2020 GEOG205 past papers that were focused on JC's section of lectures?

For [Emma's] sections of the lectures, should we look at the past papers that were 2019 and after? As I remember Meg telling in one of the watch party's that your section of lectures might not be included in the old past papers.""

A: Yes, for sure. (Note that for the summer semester exams there would likely be just one question per lecturer, so you have to spot which question looks mostly familiar to our material).
JC's material has been taught in S2 2021; Summer 2020; and all the way back to 2015 semester 2 and summer semesters. 
Emma's material has been taught in S2 2021; S2 2020; Summer 2020; and in summers all the way to 2016 except 2018.

I hope that answers your query!

Journal/Media Article Claims

Hello,¬†

I wanted to ask about the difference in misleading claims and statistically sound statements?
For example can a non statically sound statement be misleading, for example if technically the statement made in the media article is right, saying something like 'running three laps of the field increase the heart beat rate' but it doesn't include any CI, so like saying something like 'running three laps of the field increase your heartbeat rate, on average, somewhere between...'¬†
Would that be counted as misleading or it is simply just lacking detail and is not actually misleading?¬†¬†

and also not stating the population of interest or whatever the population was that was studied in the study, would this also count as misleading? For example running laps on the field may be associated with increase in heartbeats per minute, this could be misleading as it doesn't state who this information is important to so it should say something like,¬†
running laps on the field may be associated with an increase in heartbeats per minute for New Zealand Men aged 18 - 40 years old¬†
?¬†

2019 question 4 (i)  (11/7/2022, 11:30:44 PM)

the question:
Jed is 25 years old, single, tattooed, has a prominent facial scar and is generallydishevelled. Consider the following alternatives:A: Jed is an arts studentB: Jed is an arts student who has previously spent time in prison¬†¬†

Hello, I was confused with how this would be justified as a conjunction fallacy but I read the previous response about heuristics and want ask,¬†

if this question was worded like¬†
A: Jed is an student¬†
B: or she is in prison¬†
then it would be a representative heuristic that is using the best rate fallacy as from the descriptions given most people will choose biasly¬†

but if it is worded like it is in the original question then it will be a conjunction¬† fallacy?

Confusion of inverse  (11/7/2022, 11:06:37 PM)

Would a Good way in describe the confusion of inverse be,¬†

The confusion of inverse is when people confusion the probability of 'A given that B' with 'B given that A' and vice versa and think that these two probabilities are the same. This happens when our brain tries to find short cuts to answering the question and we confuse the two probabilities. (as a side note would this confusion of inverse be counted as a heuristic or something else?) (also does the brain finding short-cuts only apply to heuristics or can also apply to this as well?) This happens when people overlook base rate and denominators of the probability they are trying to find.¬†

2020 Questions 3 (c)



I dont understand why it increase as is the prevalence is 50% then virus present and absent will be 500 each hence the sensitivity would be (0.95 x 500 = 475) 475/500 and (iii) would be 475/955 = 49.7% (as 0.96 x 500 = 480 and 480 + 475 = 955), hence wouldn't this be a decrease?¬†

Also I don't understand the justification given for this, is there another way or lecture that i can look back to to get a different means of explanation?¬†

Hey I was just wondering how to approach this past exam question.

'Discuss why people‚Äôs participation in environmental management should be seen as a process rather than an outcome.'

When it says ""Discuss"" are we meant to argue for and against the statement that participation is a process? Or are we supposed to make 3 arguments showing why participation is a process?

Hi, I'm a bit confused about the answer for this one. Are we supposed to frame it in a context and would we miss out on full marks if we don't frame it in a context? I.e. just say ""Between August 2018 and August 2019, the average median number of days to sell residential properties in Auckland has increased by 2 days.""
Thanks heaps

Kenzi has been working hard to make sure your Assignment 4 grades were available to you before your exam, and we have had an additional two markers moderating your essay grades.¬†There were some great ideas in this assessment, well done!¬†

The main feedback for this assessment is the same as in previous ones - please make sure you¬†read the question carefully¬†and ensure all your ideas are responding to what the question is asking you to do.¬†If there are multiple parts to a question or it covers several ideas or concepts, make sure you address all parts of the question. The main feedback was:¬†

Overall students showed a good understanding of the essay question though there is a reasonable variation in terms of those who did well and not so well on this assignment. Higher marks were given for those assessments that showed a good understanding of environmental racism and effectively linked climate change to environmental racism. Lower marks were given for those assessments that showed understanding of only environmental racism, and made good points but with weaker links, to how climate change is an example of environmental racism.¬†

¬†

We are in individual negotiations with a few of you regarding extenuating personal circumstances and extensions, so please do keep in communication if that is you. While we can't discuss the exam with you during/after you have taken it, we can still be in contact about hand-in of other assessment.

Finally, I know some of you have had the concern that you can't yet view the Inspera exam on your dashboards. I confirmed with the Examinations Office today and the¬†exam will be made visible on your Inspera dashboard sometime today (they usually load it several days in advance of the exam).

All the very best for your exam this week - go well.

Exam Answers

Hello!¬†

I wanted to ask if in our exam we are allowed to copy and paste (episodically for the journal questions) pre-written things (that we have prepared before hand, written in our own words) into the exam if a similar question is in the exam.¬†

For example I have pre-written and practised writing some of the summary questions, like what is the objectives, rationale and limitations and authors of the study and if in the exam a question is what is the objective of the study, then is it okay to copy and paste what I wrote before onto the exam? or will that be picked up on inspera?¬†

I was just just asking because I am a slow typer and it would be helpful if I could copy and paste bits and then adjust the question to the answer if required. And obviously everything that I will copy and paste will be in my own words and not directly from anywhere else like the articles.¬†

case studies

Hi,¬†
I'm not sure if this has already been discussed, but are we allowed to use case studies that have been mentioned in the lectures/ tutorials in our exam? Or are we expected to look beyond the lectures and find case studies elsewhere (eg. course readings, news articles etc)?

I was planning on doing a mixture of both, but just wanted to double-check.
Thank you!

U21 is offering a free online, international internship opportunity for 
students around the world from December 2022 to February 2023. 

U21 Sustainable Micro-internships 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvN0~wpuDv8S~xb~Gv_a~yK8xqgqI7H7jB~gTz7~Pv8p&2=39054> 
allow you to work with your fellow students from across the globe, sharing 
knowledge and expertise whilst immersing yourself in a commercial 
organisation. Not only will you form quick partnerships with 
sustainability-minded students around the world, but you'll also challenge 
your abilities, whilst developing key skills enabling you to thrive in the 
modern workplace.

Over the two-week programme you will be presented with an ongoing 
sustainability challenge from your host employer and work in groups to 
innovate a solution and how to communicate this with senior stakeholders. 
The internships involve 2 x 2.5 hour live online sessions at the start and 
end of the 2 week programme, with the rest of the project work undertaken 
flexibly, online around your other commitments.

As a result of the programme, you will develop:

Agility - your ability to adapt to new environments, to grasp topics 
outside of your academic specialism and work with difference.

International Collaboration - first-hand experience of working across 
different timezones, languages and cultures, bringing together global 
knowledge to deliver results for an employer.

Influence - your ability to build trust and solve complex problems quickly.

Presentation Skills - your ability to clear convey complex information to 
your stakeholders.

Teamwork -your ability to work with a new and globally diverse team to 
deliver a solution.

Successful completion of the programme and all activities will earn you the 
Leading Change micro-credential which you can display on your LinkedIn 
profile, demonstrating that you have developed the skills to tackle complex 
global issues and stand up as a leader.

We hope that you will want to join up for this free programme. Please note 
that there is a limited number of spaces per member university and U21 will 
operate a waiting list once all allocated spaces are filled.

Applications close on the 18 November 2022 at Midnight (GMT).

Apply now!

data distribution  (11/4/2022, 12:42:43 PM)

Sketch a possible distribution for the amount of rubbish sent to landfill by Aucklanders every
year. Explain and justify the shape of the distribution you sketched. Explain what statistic should be used for reporting the average of your sketched distribution.
¬†
I expect the distribution to be skewed, perhaps at both ends, with
a (small) proportion of Aucklanders/households sending no rubbish to
landfill, and a small proportion sending a lot of rubbish to landfill. I would
therefore use the median amount of rubbish to report the average of my
sketched distribution because it is unlikely to be a symmetric distribution.
(Will accept other appropriately justified answers/sketches).


what is the difference¬† between¬† skewed at both ends and being symmetric? I would have assumed due¬† to the small amount of people on other both sides (minimum rubbish/lots of rubbish)¬† that it would be bell shaped therefore the¬† mean¬† would be appropriate?¬†

risk  (11/4/2022, 12:02:42 PM)

also been staring at this way too long.....¬† could I get an explanation in really simple wording please.¬†

question:¬†
The reduced risk of 28 per cent quoted in the media article can also be expressed as a relative
risk. Calculate this relative risk and interpret it in words suitable for a news media audience.
¬†
answer:¬†
1f(ii) Increased risk = (Relative Risk ‚Äì 1) x 100%
Therefore, -28 = (Relative Risk ‚Äì 1) x 100%
i.e., Relative Risk (RR) = 0.72

Past Exam 2020 Question 3 (d)  (11/4/2022, 11:24:48 AM)

""Young infants are susceptible to bronchitis and pneumonia. Scientists are developing a new immunisation to prevent infants from contracting bronchitis and pneumonia. A side effect of this new immunisation is that the infant may develop a case of the common 'flu, therefore the infant should be monitored closely for a few days after the immunisation. Extensive research has shown that 10% of infants who have this new immunisation develop this side effect.

When presented with this information, only 20% of new parents indicated that they would immunise their child. Explain why this may be so, and describe how the immunisation information could be presented to produce a different result. ""

The question stated above is the 2020 question 3 (d).¬†
¬†my response to this question was¬†
With this information, only 20% of new parents felt like they would immunise their children, because the last sent, which is 'extensive research has shown that 10% of infants who have this new immunisation develop this side effect' is phrased in a negative way, saying that the children will develop the side effect even though that percentage that does is very low. Therefore, as psychologically most people tend to avoid taking the risk of having the side effects in their children's body rather than take the risk of getting the immunisation.¬†

Hence, a better way to phrase the last sentence would have been something along the lines of 'Extensive research has shown that 90% of infants who have this new immunisation do not develop this side effect.'

when I checked the model answers for this question, it used the word 'negative frame' like the it was worded in a negative frame, whereas I just said it was worded in the negative way, hence my question is that to get the marks (it was worth 3 marks) is it essential that I incorporate the 'negative frame' in my answer or if I just say 'negative way' it will still get me the marks.¬†

I wanted to ask about this because in some of my other courses they are picky with which words we should use in the answer otherwise we don't get the marks.¬†

Exam Article Table  (11/3/2022, 7:00:31 PM)

Hello,¬†
I wanted some clarification about tables in the article if they are possible to answer,¬†

I wanted to ask what does it mean by % change?¬†
I also wanted to know that the mean difference the is referred to in the CI is gotten from minusing the mean time 1 from mean time 2 (M1 - M2)?¬†

And I don't know if you are able to answer this question, but if I were to draw a graph for depression and anxiety level change, and I wanted to draw a bar graph then would I have the value for the mean difference in the bar graph and then have some arrow bars for that value?¬†

Also what does the t mean in the tables? and is this value a point of interest for our exam? Or is the only points of interest from the table is the highlighted bits?

Experiments vs Observational conclusions  (11/3/2022, 1:01:16 PM)

Hello!¬†

I am aware that in a observational study you can not imply causation hence any claims made about the study should have the word 'may'. For example instead of saying phone use results in headaches, a more accurate statement would be ""phone use may result in headaches"" (in an observational study).¬†

However if the study design was an experimental study, then are we still required to use may in the statement, in consideration that there was random allocation between two groups?

Kia ora Matthew,

On Thursday 27 October, the inaugural Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World 
University Rankings for Sustainability were announced.

I am pleased to let you know that the University of Auckland has ranked 
tenth place globally.

This means we are the only university in the world ranked in the top 10 for 
the leading sustainability rankings:

   - QS World University Ranking for Sustainability 
   - Time Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, where we rank 
   sixth globally 

This is an outstanding result that reflects the University's commitment to 
sustainability in its broadest sense.

The new QS sustainability rankings measure how universities are taking 
action to tackle the world's greatest environmental, social and governance 
challenges. You can read more about the result and the new rankings by

Uploading  (11/2/2022, 11:45:42 AM)

Roughly how many questions do we have to upload graphs to? I was just asking because I feel like it will take me a long time to download and upload the graph question and if there is more that one of these questions then I need to rethink how I am going to manage my time.¬†

Also, I looked through last years paper and in some of them we have to sketch graphs as well using the tools on inspera, and do these have to be as precise as the one we did in Assignment two or we it be fine if it's missing titles and the values on axis?¬†

letter to editors

Hello!¬†

for this section of the exam when we write a letter to the editor, I remember we are suppose to state eight points,¬†
I remember that they were state we have read the original article¬†
- any misleading claims from the newspaper article¬†
- state how the incorrect version of the claim can be corrected¬†
- any limitations (is this worth 2 marks?...it is unclear in the exam sheet)
- if will believe the findings or not with justification (is this worth two marks??..it is unclear in the exam sheet)
- any recommendations¬†

these are only six points... am I missing any? or are some of them rewarded two points?¬†

Also are we writing a response to the article that has already been given to us or a new one and if it is the one that is already given to us can we make a draft of this and rewrite this in the exam? for example can we prepare a rough answer and then copy and paste it in the exam and not be penalised for it? Or are we not advised to do this?

People's Participation as a Process rather than an outcome

Hi there!

I was just wondering what is meant by people's participation being a process as opposed to an outcome? I have a fair idea about what it might mean, but this seems to be a pretty common question asked in exams from what I have seen in past papers, and just wanted to get clarification.¬†

With the summer break just round the corner, now is the opportunity to gain 
practical work experience with leading companies and organisations and 
apply for the Southeast Asia Centre of Asia-Pacific Excellence (SEA CAPE)'s Market 
and Industry Placement Programme (MIPP). 
<https://uoa.custhelp.com/rd?1=AvN0~wqSDv8S~xb~Gv_a~yLgxqgqI7H7jB_4Tz7~Pv9x&2=40204>

Open to all full-time tertiary students, MIPP gives selected students up to 
90 or more hours of work experience with host businesses on a project 
relating to new or established ideas with Southeast Asian markets.

A unique added benefit of this programme is the support of workshops and 
seminars run by SEA CAPE and its partners, that open students and their 
host business to a wide network of connections and practical knowledge 
around the countries and related industries. A recent SEA CAPE programme 
participant had this to say: ""I have been immensely privileged to have 
entered the great network SEA CAPE creates. I've learnt so much and met so 
many people during my short involvement.""

prac questions given to us for calc questions in exam

Hello...¬†
for this question...¬†
Calculate the ‚Äòflesh-eating‚Äô disease incidence rate per 100,000 peoplefor the years 1990 and 2008.¬†
would this be the right way to approach the question...¬†¬†
in 1990 there are 12 cases and a pop of 3,410,000... so I would
divide 3410000 by 100000
which equals 34.1¬†
then I would divide 12 by 34.1¬†
= 0.3519¬†
hence the rate would be .35 (2dp) per 100000 people?¬†

and in 2008 there were 80 cases from the population of 4,173,400,¬†
so divide 41734000 by 100000¬†
= 41.734¬†
then i would divide 80 by 41.734¬†
= 1.9169¬†
hence the rate would be 1.9 per 100000 people?¬†

I was just wanting to see if I did it the right way because on the sheet only the answers are given not how it was calculated.
Thank You!

Help with Past Exam Question

Hi there!

I was just wondering if anyone could help me understand this question from one of the previous exams:
¬†
Discuss how neoliberalism and marketisation affect the management of environmental resources. Use examples to illustrate your answer.


I'm not sure what I would discuss if I were asked this in the exam, or more so, what neoliberalism and marketisation mean.

Any help would be appreciated! :)

Thanks!

Examples to include in answers
