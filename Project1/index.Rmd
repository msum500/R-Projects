## My meme

My meme represents myself when I do something dumb as I often make silly mistakes.
The motivation of my meme is to show how my brain acts sometimes when doing daily activities.

## My animated GIF

My animated GIF shows a cat rotating 360 degrees and the text "MEOW" forming after each frame.
The motivation of my GIF was to create something I thought was cute so I decided to use an image of a cat as the base of my GIF.
